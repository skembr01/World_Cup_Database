This project was done through FreeCodeCamp. The project entailed creating two bash scripts and working with PostgreSQL. The first script inserted data into a psql database with a provided csv data file. Then, the second script entailed querying the database once the first script had been ran. 

In this repositiory are the project data, the two bash scripts, as well as the psql dump of the database.
